# 📱 SetupFlow Lab

> Simulate, decode, and analyze iOS Setup.app behavior using Python, plists, and dynamic config logic.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

**SetupFlow Lab** is a modular Python framework designed to reverse-engineer and simulate the behavior of Apple’s Setup.app, especially on devices stuck on the Hello screen. It lets researchers, developers, and enthusiasts explore onboarding flags, automate setup flow simulation, and generate diagnostic reports from the `com.apple.purplebuddy.plist`.

---

## 🧰 Features

- ✅ Modular onboarding simulation (language, Wi-Fi, Activation, Apple ID)
- 🔁 Timestamped setup progression tracking
- 🔒 Backup, restore, and modify plist states safely
- 📄 Step report generation in JSON or plaintext
- ⚙️ Config-driven setup behavior (skip steps, simulate delays)
- 🧪 Optional SQLite logging for traceability
- 🧬 Extendable for GUI interfaces or OTA diffing

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AppleBoy6/setupflow_lab.git
   cd setupflow_lab

1. Install optional dependenciespip install rich
2. Configure behavior Customize `config.json`:{
  "simulateActivationDelay": true,
  "skipAppleID": false,
  "fakeErrorCodes": ["activation_failed"]
}
3. Run the simulatorpython setup_simulator.py

🧪 Use Cases

• iOS activation diagnostics and simulation
• Reverse-engineering Setup.app flow
• Research and tooling for stuck devices
• Plist-based setup modeling and reporting

🚀 SetupFlow Lab: Welcome & Roadmap

Welcome to the official SetupFlow Lab project by @AppleBoy6 — your home for decoding and simulating Apple’s Setup.app behavior on iOS devices.

🎯 Project Goals

• Build a modular, logging-enabled simulator for onboarding flows
• Parse, backup, and modify the `com.apple.purplebuddy.plist`
• Explore forensic diagnostics and activation bypass concepts (research only)
• Create a clean foundation for GUI, multilingual support, and OTA plist diffing


🛠️ Upcoming Features

• SQLite-based trace logger
• Report generator (JSON/txt)
• Region-aware setup flag simulation
• Edge-case testing (missing keys, corrupted plist)


🤝 How to Contribute

• Share feedback or test cases
• Submit pull requests with modules or config enhancements
• Log issues related to device simulation, plist structure, or flow logic


Let’s build something powerful, transparent, and helpful to the iOS forensic community! 🔍📱
